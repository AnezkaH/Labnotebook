This paper related to the **applicability** of genomics in a clinical setting.  The paper details the struggles associated with clinicians being unprepared for genomic interventions or interpreting results.  

The paper was published in the journal of Science Translation Medicine. The authors are from a range of North Western Universities in the USA.  
1. Potential perils of unprepardness: intorduces the idea of genetic exceptionalism 
1. Defining prepardness: there is no universal definition so we need to create a support system to educate and train the 
current physicians 
1. Another relative challenge includes incorporating genomic information into clinical health records 

The table presented in the paper details how EPA's (entrusted proffensional activities) relate to family history (documentation), genetic testing for patient management and genetic information for treatment decisions.  

Genomics Aotearoa address the lack of capabilities in the area of clinical genomics in NZ.  They present the following outcomes that they intend to address: 
* To apply genomic diagnostics to a group of 50 families with a child (or children) with an undiagnosed developmental disorder
* To link the research sector with the clinical diagnostic sector across NZ to build capability and embed tools and pipelines to improve clinical genomics diagnostics in NZ
* To introduce clinical genomics into disadvantaged communities with a high proportion of MƒÅori and Pacific people
* To develop and expand linkages between the research and diagnostic genomics sectors in NZ

These outcomes address the lack of laboratory services in NZ, they do not however, address the ability or prepardness of NZ physicians for clinical genetics.  The table presented may be a very useful starting point for NZ to then add to, to ensure the practices are relevant to all New Zealanders.  This would require the incorporation of tikanga Maori.  


## The value of genetic risk scores in precision medicine for diabetes

The paper was published in the Expert review for precision medicine and drug development.  The authors are from Oxford University.  

The paper summaries in a very short paragraph what genetic risks scores are and why they are so hard to use.  The paper then describes the types of genetic variants that have been robustly associated with diabetes (common, uncommon and individual variants).  The complexity of using such genetic information means the prospects for using genetic risk predictors is poor.  Yet the authors maintain they are optimistic. 

Paper describes the use of the C-statistics for predictions, 50% is chance, 80% is usable in clinics.  One of the first T2D analysis gave a C-statistic of 60%.  This is not very good.  The latest C-statistic from the large UKBIO bank analysis raised this to high 60s.  The authors seemed optimistic about this increase however, this is still no where near clinical applicability of 80%.  

Introduction to the 'palette' model which takes into consideration of genetic and non-genetic components, define clusters of T2D-risk loci into similar mechanisms of actions.  These clusters are then given their own process-specific GRS, this describces the genetic contribution to each intermediate step.  These deconstructed risk scores are able to capture diverse aspects of the clinical het- erogeneity within diabetes
