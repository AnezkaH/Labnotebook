This paper related to the **applicability** of genomics in a clinical setting.  The paper details the struggles associated with clinicians being unprepared for genomic interventions or interpreting results.  

The paper was published in the journal of Science Translation Medicine. The authors are from a range of North Western Universities in the USA.  
1. Potential perils of unprepardness: intorduces the idea of genetic exceptionalism 
1. Defining prepardness: there is no universal definition so we need to create a support system to educate and train the 
current physicians 
1. Another relative challenge includes incorporating genomic information into clinical health records 

The table presented in the paper details how EPA's (entrusted proffensional activities) relate to family history (documentation), genetic testing for patient management and genetic information for treatment decisions.  

Genomics Aotearoa address the lack of capabilities in the area of clinical genomics in NZ.  They present the following outcomes that they intend to address: 
* To apply genomic diagnostics to a group of 50 families with a child (or children) with an undiagnosed developmental disorder
* To link the research sector with the clinical diagnostic sector across NZ to build capability and embed tools and pipelines to improve clinical genomics diagnostics in NZ
* To introduce clinical genomics into disadvantaged communities with a high proportion of MƒÅori and Pacific people
* To develop and expand linkages between the research and diagnostic genomics sectors in NZ

These outcomes address the lack of laboratory services in NZ, they do not however, address the ability or prepardness of NZ physicians for clinical genetics.  The table presented may be a very useful starting point for NZ to then add to, to ensure the practices are relevant to all New Zealanders.  This would require the incorporation of tikanga Maori.
