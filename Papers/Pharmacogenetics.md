 This paper was published in 2019 by a group of Pakistani researchers. 
 
 They had 300 responders, 300 non-responders and 300 healthy individuals for a case and control study.  
 
 The findings showed that the overexpression of allele A of the rs3088442 G>A variant may act as a protective allele and is 
 associated with the clinical response to metformin. 
 
 They definded responders as those who were on metformin and responding well. Non-responders were not responding and so another treatment 
 was added.
