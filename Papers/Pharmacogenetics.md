 This paper contradicts the findings of many other studies.  Overall, results found that there was no significant contribution of these five variants to glycemic response.  The authors suggests that despite the significant findings of other studies the nine cadidate variants in transporter genes have little contribution to variability in glycemic response to metformin in T2D.  
 
 * there were 7,968 MetGen participants of European ancestry 
 * they also used mono-therapy and add-on therapy to define metformin response as well as HbA1c changes 
 * they considered dose by gene interactions, we can not do this because we dont have the dose data 
 * also looked at any variant interactions of significance

 This paper was published in 2019 by a group of Pakistani researchers. 
 
 They had 300 responders, 300 non-responders and 300 healthy individuals for a case and control study.  
 
 The findings showed that the overexpression of allele A of the rs3088442 G>A variant may act as a protective allele and is 
 associated with the clinical response to metformin. 
 
 They definded responders as those who were on metformin and responding well. Non-responders were not responding and so another treatment 
 was added.
