This paper was published in Nature in 2018 by Tanya, Tony and other collaborators.  

Liver, kidneys and gut have been confirmed sites of regulation though GWAS studies.  

Key Points of the Paper 
* hyperuricaemia to deposition of crystals lead to the immune response that causes gout 
* GWAS has revealed that the genetic basis of hyperuricaemia is dominated by loci contaning urate transporters involved in excretion of urate
* the progression to clinical gout is not well understood, however loci in the activiation and activity of NLRP3 inflammasome associate with gout 
* GWAS are revealing uncommon, population specific variants that provde insight into the pathogenesis of hyperuricaemia and gout.  These provide oppurtunities for clinical intervention 
* Variants that predict the response of individuals with hyperuricaemia to urate-lower drugs are being identified 

The major GWAS studies were done in European, East Asian an African American populations.  The most common associations were with SLC2A9 (GLUT9), SLC22A12 (URAT1), ABGC2 (ABGC2).  SLC22A9 is a pan-population locus that associates with gout.  SLC22A12 and ABGC2 are found in throughtout the world indicating a central role in urate excretion and pathogenesis to gout.  

THe lack of large GWAS in non-European populations limits the inter-population comparisons.  

Table presented summaries ALL the variants associate with serum-urate levels.  Another table has the uncommon and population-specific varints associated with serum-urate levels.  

Missing heritablity - most of the heritablilty of serum urate levels is accounted for my the common variant, however there is still come missing heritalilty that can be credited to gene-gene and gene-environment interations.  Further more some of the missing heritablily will be accounted for by uncommon or population-specific variants.  Many of these variants have been identified but not replicated.  

In the abscence of data from very large GWAS studies, candidate gene approches have lead to important results.  NLRP3 inflammasome responses causing gout. PPARGC1B increased risk of gout in Han Chinese (mitochondria).  Reduced mitochondria copy number associated with gout.  APOA1 associates with gout but not serum urate levels, potentially involved in the progression to gout.  

Clinical applicability and response to urate lower treatments:  ABCG2 Arg141Lys, associates with hyperuricaemia to gout and prescence of tophi in Pacifica. Urate lower therapies have their main effect by targeting the renal urate transporter URAT1, SLC22A12.  

This paper provide a comprehensive over view of GWAS for serum urate levels, introduces key findnigs from candidate gene approch studiea and most importantly points out the lack of genetic knowledge regarding the progression of hyperuricaemia to gout.  The authors also introduce the idea the genetic variants may reduce the response of individuals to urate-lowering therapies.
