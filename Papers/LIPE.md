This paper was published in September 2018, by a group of Japanesse researchers.  

* exome wide association studies for CAD in Japanese patients 
* 1,500 early on set CAD cases, 6,500 controls 
* used GeneMANIA to asses network of gene-gene interactions 

After EWAS and application of Fishers exact test there were 170 SNPs.  After logistic regression and adjustment with age, sex 
and prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia there were 162 SNPs.  

Stepwise forward selection procedure of the effects of SNPs on CAD = 53 SNPs (accounted for 15.5% of the cause of CAD) 

Association between SNPs with CAD and intermediate phenotypes resulted in the LIPE variant being associated with (they used 
Pearson's coefficient test).  Variant had not previously been associated with any traits.  

Significant findings 
* LIPE associated with hypertriglyceridemia and hyperuricemia 
* gene ontology analysis revealed that LIPE (cholestrol and triglyceride metabolism) may serve a role in development of CAD 

Was able to get onto the GeneMANIA [website](http://genemania.org/) to have a play.
