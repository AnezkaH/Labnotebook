# 5th July 

Attended mid-year Research Bazaar morning session.  I created the Labnotebook repositry.  I also made the Protocols, Analyses and Diary directories.  Tried but failed at uploading MWC variant analyses markdown code and html. 

Afternoon worked on literature review - Maori and Pacific community engagement and pharmacogenetics sections.
