 # 26 Thursday 
 
 Reviewing CoreEx extraction.  LIPE analysis touch up.  
 
 Thinking about committee members.  
 
 # 25 Wednesday 
 
 Test extractions of CoreExome data from BCSNPmax to understand why so many markers were left out of the NPH export.  Searching Poly wide data for more Metformin response data to include in the SLC22A3 analysis. Spoke with Tanya about the missing alleles from the Core Exome extract and it turns out that there were a large number of Czech individuals who were sequenced on a completely different array.  This means there are 500,000+ alleles that will not have data for NPH.  Tanya gave me access to a batch 1 specific file that only has the subjects and marers for NPH.  There are 292 in the NPH specific file.  312 on the full file.  This is because there are ~20 people who were recruited with NPH but are not actually Maori.  We only want those who are Maori for this analysis. 
 
 # 24th Tuesday 
 
 Extracted the NPH TaqMan data from BCSNPmax.  Genotypes and Pehnotypes in seperate files.  Extracted the CoreExome data in PLINK format (more compressed).  Data on server. 
 
 # 23rd Monday 
 
Extracted the table of ethinicty information from R to look at the 'NAs' (used the 'write.table' function, make sure you use the sep= "\t' arguement to make the columns tab seperated and able to open in Excel).  There are a number of participants who do not have an assigned ETH_SPECIFIC_Code. I am going through manually and assigning them to 1 of the 7 groups, and leaving the European/Caucasian particiapnts as 'NA'.  
 
 Example:  
 
 SUBJECT GPANCESTRY 0.35 Maori and 0.65 European = NZ Maori. 
 SUBJECT GPANCESTRY 0.25 Maori , 0.5 Samoan, 0.25 European = Mixed 
 
 Of the 5395 particiapants with NA in the ETH_SPECIFIC_Code column I manually changed 485 participants.
