Did the nation specific linear regressions for BMI and waist again, this time adjusting only with age and sex (NOT INCLUDING PCA's). 
Did the Samoan LIPE linear regression with cholestrol. 
Started the full LIPE analysis again this time in the 'healthy' subset of Polynesians (No T2D and no Gout). 

# 9th Tuesday 

Looked on the [this genome browser](https://bioinf.eva.mpg.de/jbrowse/?loc=19%3A42909572..42909663&tracks=hg19_1000g%2CDenisova%2CAltai%2CSS6004477%2CSS6004478%2CSS6004472&highlight=) for the variants rs169xxxx and rs104xxxx in the Denisovan genome.  

# 5th Friday 

Supervisor meeting 

# 4th Thursday

Worked with Megan and Matt to calcualte LD and Poly freq of LIPE rs370955937.  

Here is the protocol for [calcualting LD](../../Protocol/Calc_Poly_LD.md).  
Here is the protocol for [calculating allele frequencies](../../Protocol/Calc_Poly_freq.md).  

# 3rd Wednesday 

Tried to merge the Gout and DM databases with metformin response data in R.  But it didn't work.  Re-downloaded the data to filter again and merge differently.   

# 2nd Tuesday  

Lab meeting.  Filter DM, RD and Gout databases.  

# 1st Monday 

Completed the nation-specific waist circumference analysis.  Cleaned up the LIPE BMI R-Markdown.

Exploring what other metformin response/diabetes therapy data we have for the Gout, Renal Disease and Diabetes Mellutis databases.
