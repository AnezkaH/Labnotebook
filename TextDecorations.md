## Text decorations 
We're talking about **bolds**, *italics*, and ~strickouts~. 

This is another way to do that __bold__ and _italicised_ words. 

Now we can combine **_bold and italicised_**.

### Bullet points

This is how you make bullet point list:
* bullet 1
* bullet 2 
* bullet 3 

This is another way to make bullet points: 
- bullet 1
- bullet 2
- bullet 3  

### Numbered lists 

Numbered lists:
1. Thing 1
2. Thing 2
3. Thing 3 

The number before the item doesn't matter, the document will correct the numberings. 

### Checked lists 

TODO's and done's:

- [ ] item one 
- [ ] item two
- [x] item three 

### Nesting lists 

You can also nest lists within a list 
- item one 
  - sub-item 
- item two 
  - sub-item 1
  - sub-item 2 
- item three

##Tables 

Let's make a clean table within markdown:

| Name | Age | Department | Job | 
|---|---|---|---|
|Riku|25|Biochemistry|ARF| 
|Ruth|34|Biochemistry|ARF|
|Mik|old|Biochem|stats guy| 

If you want to make a column centered add a colon like this: 

| Name | Age | Department | Job | 
|---|---|---|:---:|
|Riku|25|Biochemistry|ARF| 
|Ruth|34|Biochemistry|ARF|
|Mik|old|Biochem|stats guy|

##Markdown paragraphs, texts, and quotes 

So this sentence contains only a single white space inbetween the words.
But this      sentence      contains a  lot of   single white        space inbetween the        words.

This is how you print quotes:

> "You're a wizard, Harry.

## Links and hyperlinks

The syntax is relatively simple:

This is a link to Google Scholar [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.nz/)

```
echo hello world 
cd / 
rm- 
```
